This Supplementary Folder contains the Ruby code 
required to reproduce the post-coding automated
data processing done by Jennifer Rachwani and 
Victor Santamaria-Gonzalez in the course of their
PHD studies.

Included are:

OPENSHAPA_API.rb -- the OPENSHAPA Apis used by the
team in their use of OPENSHAPA for processing the
coded video data.  OPENSHAPA has ceased active
developement as of the time of the creation of this
file, and is last known to be on version 1.12.

Datavyu_API.rb -- the Datavyu API that was
experimented with when the team explored switching
to Datavyu in late 2013.  This may be outdated, and
it is recommended you use the latest Datavyu APIs.

reachDataProcessor_new.rb -- The Ruby code that does
the bulk of the analysis and file saving.  Some
modification may be necessary for the code to work
best with your system and setup.

OpenSHAPACodeDictionary.txt -- a listing of the codes
and data reachDataProcessor_new.rb is intended to
produce.
